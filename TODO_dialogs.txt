~~~~~
James's observations:

Starting room:
1. Footstep noises don't disappear upon walking to an interactable and interacting without letting go of the keys. -- 
		Currently bugged in the sense that if you hold down keys during dialogue, you get silent footsteps.
2. Player movability when opening the notebook and mashing ctrl several times is inconsistent. Also wrecks things if multiple conversations are started.
3. Table is misaligned
4. Can't make maintenance requests...? 

Office: 
1. The light has a very obvious upper bound (Not fixable due to single layer sprites)

Shower room:

General:
1. After playing a while, there's a null reference in dayAfternoon.DayEnd() (Line 60 & 63 of gameManager)
2. If you try to talk to someone and a red blob hits you, you're not allowed to move anymore when you wake up (Only happened once)
3. Very glitchy behavior upon getting day resetted when entering a room, showerman room in particular.
4. Dialogue boxes sometimes give day reset invuln. After gathering all of the blobs it's possible to roam. Not sure how to handle this case.
5. When walking diagonally and entering a room, it's necessary to let go of the keys before walking diagonally again; usually you're constrained to walk vertically.

Owl room:

Snoop room:
1. Make it so the TV shuts off if you shove a soda on it

Arcade room:
1. You don't actually get a soda from the machine yet despite what the text tells you, and the state of the machine resets upon room entry.

UI:
1. After a while the clock's hands desync, making it difficult to tell time. The clock also ends at "6:30"; not sure how the clock's supposed to look so left it alone.
2. Rare: It's possible to not have the day reset under certain circumstances. Couldn't reproduce.
3. Minor issue: Audio clipping occurs if running back and forth. Recommended to scale the audio down.
