Manager and it's subrooms everything


~~~~~
James's observations:

Starting room:
1. Footstep noises don't disappear upon walking to an interactable and interacting without letting go of the keys. -- 
		Currently bugged in the sense that if you hold down keys during dialogue, you get silent footsteps.
2. Player movability when opening the notebook and mashing ctrl several times is inconsistent. Also wrecks things if multiple conversations are started.
3. There's a weird race condition with the bed that sometimes freezes you until the next day event

Writer room:
Make it so that after every question, the writer comments on your idea and then tells you to come and check back after she's written a bit

Office: 
1. The light has a very obvious upper bound (Not fixable due to single layer sprites)
2. The lock thing leads out of the room...?

Shower room:

Mom & child room:
1. The child's dialogue should be fixed

General:
1. After playing a while, there's a null reference in dayAfternoon.DayEnd() (Line 60 & 63 of gameManager)
2. Very glitchy behavior upon getting day resetted when entering a room, showerman room in particular.
3. When walking diagonally and entering a room, it's necessary to let go of the keys before walking diagonally again; usually you're constrained to walk vertically.

Snoop room:
1. Make it so the TV shuts off if you shove a soda on it
2. Soda is bugged when delivering
3. Soda also does not reset upon sleep

Arcade room:
1. Getting coins doesn't actually do anything...?
2. The machine doesn't have proper dialogue

UI:
1. Rare: It's possible to not have the day reset under certain circumstances. Couldn't reproduce; likely not a problem anymore.
2. Minor issue: Audio clipping occurs if running back and forth. Recommended to scale the audio down.

Lobby:
1. It's possible to wait until midnight and spawn in the room

Playtest results:
1. Soda works, barring TV graphics
2. Got to the bathroom properly
3. Couldn't verify that the child "comes back" (Stole all of the coins in the vending machine but the child was still there, albeit with modified dialogue)
4. The owl has the same error as the notepad in the sense that you can move around while the prompt appears
5. Got the keypad in the arcade room to work but nothing happened
6. Got the manager prompt right (albeit with no context), but nothing happens
7. Lobby works fine.
8. Notepad is bugged if you mash hard enough, and the bed has a race condition on it
