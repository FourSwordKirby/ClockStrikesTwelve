~~~~~
James's observations:

Starting room:
1. Footstep noises don't disappear upon walking to an interactable and interacting without letting go of the keys.
2. Player movability when opening the notebook and mashing ctrl several times is inconsistent. Also wrecks things if multiple conversations are started.
3. Can't move after sleeping on the bed.
4. Can't make maintenance requests...?

Shower room:
1. I assume that it's known that the shower quest line doesn't exactly work

Hallways:
1. Not sure if it's intended but a big picture of a refrigerator appears in front of the mom & child room and I can't tell what it's supposed to do. 
The layering's inconsistent: If I'm in the room, the refrigerator's on top of the doormat, but otherwise it's below.
2. It's difficult to enter the lobby, or any other room.

Mom & Child room
1. Mom & Child dialogue is broken.

Arcade room:
1. Null pointer reference on the vending machine.
2. Basically not implemented.


Snoop room:
1. Toilet isn't accessible

General:
1. After playing a while, there's a null reference in dayAfternoon.DayEnd() (Line 60 & 63 of gameManager)

Lobby:
1. Tables have no collision
2. Can't exit the lobby

Owl room:
1. Toilet's dialogue is broken
2. Owl's dialogue is broken

UI:
1. After a while the clock's hands desync, making it difficult to tell time.
2. Rare: It's possible to not have the day reset under certain circumstances. Couldn't reproduce.
3. Minor issue: Audio clipping occurs if running back and forth. Recommended to scale the audio down.
4. Dialogue boxes temporarily give day reset invuln. After gathering all of the blobs it's possible to roam.
