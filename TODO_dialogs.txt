James's observations:

Starting room:
1. Footstep noises don't disappear upon walking to an interactable and interacting without letting go of the keys. -- 
		Currently bugged in the sense that if you hold down keys during dialogue, you get silent footsteps.
2. Player movability when opening the notebook and mashing ctrl several times is inconsistent. Also wrecks things if multiple conversations are started.
3. There's a weird race condition with the bed that sometimes freezes you until the next day event

Mom & child room:
1. The child's dialogue should be fixed

General:
2. Very glitchy behavior upon getting day resetted when entering a room, showerman room in particular.

Snoop room:
2. Soda is bugged when delivering
3. Soda also does not reset upon sleep

Arcade room:
1. Getting coins doesn't actually do anything...?
2. The machine doesn't have proper dialogue
3. The vending machine technically doesn't have proper dialogue either.

UI:
1. Rare: It's possible to not have the day reset under certain circumstances. Couldn't reproduce; likely not a problem anymore.
2. Minor issue: Audio clipping occurs if running back and forth. Recommended to scale the audio down.

Lobby:
1. It's possible to wait until midnight and spawn in the room

Playtest results:
3. Couldn't verify that the child "comes back" (Stole all of the coins in the vending machine but the child was still there, albeit with modified dialogue)
4. The owl has the same error as the notepad in the sense that you can move around while the prompt appears
5. Got the keypad in the arcade room to work but nothing happened
6. Got the manager prompt right (albeit with no context), but nothing happens
8. Notepad is bugged if you mash hard enough, and the bed has a race condition on it
