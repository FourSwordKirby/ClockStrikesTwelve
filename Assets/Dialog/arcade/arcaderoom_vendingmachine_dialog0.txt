<i>Break the soda cans! Hit the moving targets 10 times and get a soda!</i>
You would play, but you don't have enough time for this nonsense. 
Consulting the wisdom of the ancients and tales of yore, you deliver a mighty roundhouse kick at the machine's gut.
You hear an eerie cry as the machine buckles, its internal gears crunching under the force of your assault.
A few seconds later, the machine spits out a soda into its prize receptacle.
Smirking at being able to circumvent this stupid fetch quest, you snatch the soda and stash it away in your bag.


You found a <color=#ffffff>soda</color>! It is now in your inventory!
