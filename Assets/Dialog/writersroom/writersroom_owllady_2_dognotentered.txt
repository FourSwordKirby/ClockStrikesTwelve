OWL LADY : Eh... hey, what if instead, the protagonist was a <color=#ffffff>dog</color>!?

OWL LADY : Ugh, maybe I'll have a better idea for an protagonist <b>tomorrow</b>
OWL LADY : If only I had some other source of inspiration
OWL LADY : It always works better when the initial idea comes from <b>someone else</b>
