OWL LADY : Maybe I can use my struggles with it to write something... Really good...
OWL LADY : I think... I'm going to write this! Yeah, I'm really going to write this! Thank you!
OWL LADY : Do you know, I've always been afraid of my own ideas. 
OWL LADY : It's just this kind of embarrassment, to put yourself out on the line. 
OWL LADY : Because, you know... and it looks like this is your biggest fear too...
OWL LADY :  I'm most afraid of rejection...
OWL LADY : ...But now I'm going to write!
OWL LADY : Come back tomorrow and I'll have the best manuscript ever
