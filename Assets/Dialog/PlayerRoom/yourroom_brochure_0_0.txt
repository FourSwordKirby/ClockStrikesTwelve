Welcome to Hotel Infinity stranger! Where all day, I, the manager, seek to make you comfortable. 
And speaking of all day, there's a lot more to this place than meets the eye:
I like things to go according to plan, to make you feel at ease.
So what's more at ease than giving you the ability to live the same day over and over again!
That's right, I gave you infinite time. Infinite time to spend the day however you like it!
We got this <color=#00ffffff><b>watch</b></color> doohicky ticking away in the corner to help you know what time it currently is!
And once you crawl back into bed and shut your eyes, guess what?
 When you open them, it値l be the morning of the day you just had!
 You値l get to do anything you missed that day, get to experience all of life's greatest pleasures!
 Get to spend your time the way you want to.
I have everything you could ask for: a state of the arts arcade, great food, and exquisite interior design.
...
You have the company of other strangers like yourself! Go say Hi to everybody, get to know them!
 Flush their toilets! It's a great conversation starter ;)
You also got me to satisfy your every whim! I知 always down for a chat in the lobby.
In the extremely rare likelihood of any issues, just know that if you really need to,
you can call in a <color=#00ffffff><b>maintenance request</b></color>! 
And I値l have that done for you when you wake up tomorrow (or the next version of today, haha!)
