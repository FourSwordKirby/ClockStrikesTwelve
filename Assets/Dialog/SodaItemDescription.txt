It's a can of Mountain Dew.

Upon closer inspection, this can has been used already. Although the tab and the lid top have been reset to their original positions, the pungent stench of ammonia is leaking out, stealing away your appetite.

However, the can is still full. Maybe somebody else would have some use for this...?
