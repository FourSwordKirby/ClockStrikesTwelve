Game breaking bugs:
Windowed mode causes really long fades and really fast dialogue

If you leave the bedroom door as the time hits midnight it's possible for weird things to happen; you get to the next day but there's a long delay before you teleport back to your bedroom for sleeping + the notepad pops up
If you leave a room while a PSA is occurring, it should be possible to get overlapping dialogue. Unsure if this could result in game locking; not the most consistent of bugs and generally has to be forced
The clock moves while checking in; autism-tier players/players going to the bathroom/players getting interrupted by ___  can wait for the clock to advance to the afternoon PSA to cause overlapping dialogue.

QOL bugs:
[Fixed paused footsteps]
Music completely dies if red-blobbing in the arcade room/presumably other rooms until going into the mom/child/arcade rooms
Footsteps are locked in one direction/no directions if entering a room without letting go of keys; to duplicate, hold a direction while entering a room.
It's possible to get too many coins -> can't see inventory. Same with conversations I suppose

Flipping mom-child bugs
[Pending]Make black ooze not show up if you fix mom-child quest
[Pending] 9. Not yet fixed: Child stays in the arcade room with the next-to-mom dialogue if going back and forth from the arcade room -> mom & child room -> arcade room (exists in 2 places). So much for spending more time with her
[Pending] 10. Similarly, on subsequent days the child ditches the mom but the mom still thanks the player. (I also managed to move during the mom's dialogue; not sure how that happened but there are already lots of bugs)
