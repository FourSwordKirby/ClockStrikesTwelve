Game breaking bugs:
Windowed mode causes really long fades and really fast dialogue

Fix dialogue overlapping
The bed is really glitchy if you hold right -> mash A. (Best way to resolve this is to lock the game until the PSA occurs.)
[Pending]Make black ooze not show up if you fix mom-child quest

QOL bugs:
[Pending] 9. Not yet fixed: Child stays in the arcade room with the next-to-mom dialogue if going back and forth from the arcade room -> mom & child room -> arcade room (exists in 2 places). So much for spending more time with her
[Pending] 10. Similarly, on subsequent days the child ditches the mom but the mom still thanks the player. (I also managed to move during the mom's dialogue; not sure how that happened but there are already lots of bugs)
1. Footsteps are unfixed: walking while 
2. Toilet flush sound still plays when the toilet is closed
3. Trying to sleep -> touch the door before the time is set causes some weird teleporting
4. Talking to the writer spawns more conversations
5. May be a good idea to not allow the clock to advance past 12
6. Music doesn't reset to default if red-blobbing in the arcade room/presumably other rooms
