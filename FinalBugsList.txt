Game breaking bugs:
Windowed mode causes really long fades and really fast dialogue

Fix dialogue overlapping
[Pending]Make black ooze not show up if you fix mom-child quest

QOL bugs:
[Pending] 9. Child stays in the arcade room with the next-to-mom dialogue if going back and forth from the arcade room -> mom & child room -> arcade room (exists in 2 places). So much for spending more time with her
[Pending] 10. Similarly, on subsequent days the child ditches the mom but the mom still thanks the player. (I also managed to move during the mom's dialogue; not sure how that happened but there are already lots of bugs)
